            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <item>2. Much time is already lost, to the great damage of all the Kingdom, through the continuance of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiarys in the Houses.</item>
               <item>3. Those usurpers having already contracted the guilt of fomenting a new war, are necessarily engaged to obstruct all proceedings which tend to the settlement of the Kingdoms peace, whereby the service and relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> also retarded.</item>
               <item>4. The permission of those Incendiaries to sit in the Houses, may possibly give them opportunity to find a time to over vote the Parliament, and thereby stamp the image of Parliamentary Authority upon their own bloody desig<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The doting of those in the Houses, who are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be under an incapassity of sitting there, may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make the validity of all Votes, Orders and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doubtful, that either are or shal be past during their sitting.</item>

            <p>WHereas upon the 23 of August last, the Conscience of our duty to God and the Kingdom to prosecute our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation constrained us to declare our sence of the inviolable Ingagement of the Army, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to restrain those late usurpers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary power from sitting in Parliament, to obstruct all proceedings tending to the Kingdomes peace: and notwithstanding we have waited with much patience, expecting that the Parliaments zeal to the publick good would have made those Intruders &amp; Designers of mischief a burden so intollerable to their spirits, that they would rather have called for for the Armies assistance to eject them, then to have permitted them to sit there; yet all our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160479:4"/> expectations are hitherto frustrate, and no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to that end are visible, we therefore in faithfulness to our principles and in a deep sense of the blood and confusion that threatens the Nation by reason of the delays of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ehe peoples burdens, and clearing and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their Rights and Freedoms, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from those Incendiaries sitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot but humbly represent once more to your Excellency.</p>
